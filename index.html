            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as
                improving access and quality, reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion
                rates, enhancing learning outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability,
                promoting innovation and technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by
                various policies and programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy
                2020, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the
                Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by
                various stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations,
                academic institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the Indian
                central government, and the state governments have responsibility for enacting and implementing
                education policy. The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern of
                education. In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges
                (Maharashtra) or Higher Secondary Schools(most other states), and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's
                degree. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 8 years of elementary education (5 years Primary
                School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by 2 years of Higher
                Secondary Schools or Junior colleges.: 5  This pattern originated from the recommendation of the
                Education Commission of 1964–66.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">According to the Census of 2011, "every person above the age of 7 years
                who can read and write with understanding in any language is said to be literate". According to this
                criterion, the 2011 survey holds the national literacy rate to be 74.04%.The youth literacy rate,
                measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among males and 74.4% among females), while
                86% of boys and 72% of girls are literate in the 10–19 age group.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Within the Indian states, Kerala has the highest literacy rate of 93.91%
                whereas Bihar averaged 61.8% literacy. The 2001 statistics indicated that the total number of 'absolute
                non-literates' in the country was 304 million.Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in
                Rajasthan, the state with the lowest female literacy rate in India,[180] average female literacy rate is
                52.66% and average male literacy rate is 80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%.</p>
